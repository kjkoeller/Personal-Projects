# Personal-Projects
Fun personal projects that I have tasked myself to do

# Airmass
Project to calculate the most accurate airmass in time intervals of 4 minutes (60/15) as anything less is not needed. This is also supposed to show the sunset and astronomical twilight for any given day of the year.

# Line Fit
Project to fit a data set with a number of polynomial values. So far this is rudimentary and does not really output any sort of information except a few R^2 values.

# N-Body
This N-Body program uses a 4th order Runge-Kutta method that accounts for the eccentricity of each body. The output displays the energy of Earth and the program outputs the actual period and one that is calculated from different time steps and then outputs the error for each given time step.

# 3D Plotting
This program is meant to answer Classical Electrodynamics John David Jackson 3rd Edition problem 1.21b where we take a look at comparing an estimated psi value and and exact psi value and my group and I plotted the problem in 2D and I personally worked to get the 3D plot working. It outputs both the estimate and exact answers in a 3D scatter plot in the same figure. The graphs are also interactive, i.e. you can change the angle of the graph for better viewing if necessary.
