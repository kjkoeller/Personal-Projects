# Personal-Projects
Fun personal projects that I have tasked myself to do

# Airmass
Project to calculate the most accurate airmass in time intervals of 4 minutes (60/15) as anything less is not needed. This is also supposed to show the sunset and astronomical twilight for any given day of the year.

# Line Fit
Project to fit a linear, qudratic, and polynomial of degree 3 for a given data set. So far is rudimentary and does not really output any sort of information except a few R^2 values.

# N-Body
This N-Body program uses a 4th order Runge-Kutta method that accounts for the eccentricity of each body. The output displays the energy of Earth and the program outputs the actual period and one that is calculated from different time steps and then outputs the error for each given time step.
