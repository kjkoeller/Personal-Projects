# Personal-Projects
Fun personal projects that I have tasked myself to do

# Airmass
Project to calculate the most accurate airmass in time intervals of 4 minutes (60/15) as anything less is not needed. This is also supposed to show the sunset and astronomical twilight for any given day of the year.

# Line Fit
Project to fit a linear, qudratic, and polynomial of degree 3 for a given data set. So far is rudimentary and does not really output any sort of information except a few R^2 values.
